# cashcalc-backend
Backend for the CashCalc 2020 application.

This project aims to give additional support for people working in logistics to calculate transportation costs.

It is a collaboration between me and [@mark182182](https://github.com/mark182182). The frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/mark182182/cashcalc-frontend).
